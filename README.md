üì¶ What the project does
This project implements an interactive graphical application to demonstrate the operation of various classic sorting algorithms. The user can visually observe, in real time, how the algorithms manipulate the data, in addition to obtaining detailed statistics such as execution time, number of comparisons, and number of swaps performed.

The implemented algorithms include:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Shell Sort

Heap Sort

Quick Sort

Merge Sort

The project allows the data array to be filled randomly, in ascending order, or descending order, according to the user's choice.

üåü Why the project is useful
This project is an educational tool designed for students and professionals who want to better understand the internal functioning of sorting algorithms. The graphical visualization makes the learning process more intuitive, allowing users to practically observe how each algorithm behaves.

Additionally, the application provides quantitative metrics, enabling users to compare the performance of the algorithms in different scenarios, reinforcing theoretical concepts.
